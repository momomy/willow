# Automated Trading System Structure

The automated trading system is likened to an investment team. This investment team consists of five roles: Data Collector, Data Analyst, Strategist, Trader, and Recorder.

## Roles and Descriptions

### Data Collector
Gathers the necessary data for investment. In this automated trading program, the Data Collector gathers previous transaction information and necessary data using the exchange's open API.

### Data Analyst
Processes and creates the data needed by the Strategist using the data collected by the Data Collector. For example, if the Data Collector gathers transaction data, the Data Analyst creates the technical indicators needed for the strategy.

### Strategist
Based on the data collected and processed by the Data Collector and Data Analyst, the Strategist decides whether to buy, sell, or hold cryptocurrencies. If a buy or sell decision is made, the Strategist determines the price and quantity of the trade.

### Trader
Executes the trades on the actual exchange based on the decisions made by the Strategist.

### Recorder
Records the information needed for future trades during this investment process.

## Team Operation

The team belongs to an investment agent and performs investments at specific intervals. The following are some advantages of forming a team:

### Advantages

1. **Expanding Trading Areas**: For instance, there is a team investing in Exchange A. If you want to invest in Exchange B with the same investment strategy, you can easily expand the trading area by hiring a Data Collector and Trader to work in Exchange B and forming a new team.

2. **Strategy Replacement**: If you want to change the investment strategy, you can replace the existing Strategist with a new one.

In this way, the investment team can be flexibly configured and operated.
