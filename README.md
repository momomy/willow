# Willow

A flexible and resilient automated crypto trading project.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, you need to:

1. Generate a WAR file using Gradle.
2. Obtain the Upbit API keys and set them as environment variables on your system.

### Steps to Obtain Upbit API Keys

1. Visit the Upbit Open API Guide at https://upbit.com/service_center/open_api_guide.
2. Follow the instructions to generate your API keys.

### Setting Up Environment Variables

After obtaining your Upbit API keys, you need to set them as environment variables:

#### Linux / macOS

1. Open your terminal and add the following lines to your `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc` file:

   export UPBIT_OPEN_API_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key_here

   export UPBIT_OPEN_API_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here

2. Run the following command to reload the configuration:

   source ~/.bashrc

   Or if you are using Zsh:

   source ~/.zshrc

#### Windows

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run the following commands:

   setx UPBIT_OPEN_API_ACCESS_KEY "your_access_key_here"

   setx UPBIT_OPEN_API_SECRET_KEY "your_secret_key_here"

2. Restart your Command Prompt or PowerShell to apply the changes.

## Building the WAR File

To build the WAR file using Gradle, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project.
2. Run the following command to build the WAR file:

   ./gradlew clean build

   This command will generate a WAR file in the `build/libs` directory of your project.

## Running the WAR Program

Once the environment variables are set up and the WAR file is generated, you can run the program using Java.

1. Navigate to the directory containing the generated WAR file.
2. Run the following command to start the program:

   java -jar willow.war

   Replace `willow.war` with the actual name of the WAR file generated by Gradle.

### Example

Here is an example of the entire process:

1. Set the environment variables:

   export UPBIT_OPEN_API_ACCESS_KEY=XXXX

   export UPBIT_OPEN_API_SECRET_KEY=XXXX

2. Build the WAR file:

   ./gradlew clean build

3. Run the WAR file:

   java -jar build/libs/willow.war
